# Brown Dwarfs Gamma-ray Analysis with Fermi-LAT

This project is based on the published paper, https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08067. With this code, we can re-generate the plots of https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08067.

We perform the 13 years of Fermi-LAT data of 13 nearby Brown Dwarf (BD) and look for the dark (DM) capture rate in BDs. 

In the Brown_Dwarf_notebook.ipynb notebook, we show the Fermi-LAT analysis for one Brown Dwarf. Following this methodology, you can reproduce the result of all BDs. With sed_plots.ipynb, we can generate the spectral energy distribution (SED) plot (Fig.~1). We can generate the SED files (.npy) by following the analysis described in Brown_Dwarf_notebook.ipynb.

Our calculation for DM capture rate where we assume that DM annihilates into long-lived mediators and finally to gamma rays, is available in the mathematica file, BD_formulation_plots.nb. 
We perform this for the BDs but we can also extend it for any class of celestial objects. 

# Objective: To analyze Fermi-LAT data for 13 nearby Brown Dwarfs and investigate the DM capture rate in these celestial objects.

# Key Components:

Paper: The project is based on a published paper, which serves as the foundation for the research.

Code: We have code available that can be used to regenerate the plots presented in the paper. This code is likely designed to process and analyze the Fermi-LAT data.

Notebooks: There are Jupyter notebooks provided, such as "Brown_Dwarf_notebook.ipynb" and "sed_plots.ipynb," which likely contain detailed explanations and code for specific aspects of the analysis, including generating SED plots.

SED Files: The project generates SED files in .npy format, which can be used for further analysis and visualization.

Mathematica File: There's a Mathematica file, "BD_formulation_plots.nb," which is used for calculations related to the DM capture rate. It's designed to work not only for Brown Dwarfs but potentially for other celestial objects as well.

Methodology: The project seems to follow a methodology outlined in the provided notebooks, which involves data analysis and calculations related to DM capture rates, assuming DM annihilation into long-lived mediators and gamma rays.

Scope: While the project focuses on Brown Dwarfs, it's mentioned that the methodology could potentially be extended to other classes of celestial objects, demonstrating versatility and applicability.

# This is a comprehensive scientific project that combines data analysis, code, and calculations to explore the DM capture rate in Brown Dwarfs and potentially other celestial objects.
