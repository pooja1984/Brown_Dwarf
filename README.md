# Brown Dwarfs Gamma

Analysis of nearby BD with Fermi-LAT data and constraints on DM particle candidates. 

We perofrm the analysis with 13 years of Fermi-LAT data. In the notebook, we show the analysis of one Brown Dwarf. Following this methodology, you can reproduce the result of all BDs. 

In the mathematica file, you can find the calculation of capture rate and the plots related to the scattering cross-section of BDs.
